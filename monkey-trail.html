                    <h3>MONKEY TRAIL</h3>
                    <p>Monkey Trails showcases monkeys and other animals from the rainforests of Asia and Africa. Opened in 2005, it replaced an older exhibit known as the Monkey Yard. Monkey Trail is home primarily to monkeys such as guenons, mangabeys, Angola colobuses, tufted capuchins, spider monkeys, and mandrills, but it also showcases many other species of animals, such as yellow-backed duikers named Ethana, Lucius and Peep. When Peep rejected Ethana, Lucius stepped in to take care of her, which was not expected as male duikers do not take care of calves. There are three pygmy hippopotamus named Elgon, Mabel and their son Akobi. Last month, after weeks of anticipation, Mabel gave birth to Akobi, a male calf who was the first calf born at the zoo. There are also slender-snouted crocodiles. Many species of turtles, snakes, lizards, and fish can be seen in a series of water/land exhibits with underwater viewing areas. In smaller exhibits, many reptiles and amphibians such as pancake tortoises can be found, along with many species of arthropods such as Madagascar hissing cockroaches. Monkey Trail utilizes a new method of displaying arboreal animalsâ€”by climbing up an elevated walkway throughout the exhibit. Some of the horticultural highlights in Monkey Trail include a ficus tree, cycads, and a bog garden.</p>
                    <p>As of April 2019, the panda exhibit is not in operation. The pandas were repatriated to China after successfully serving the larger conservation effort for pandas.</p>
                    <p>In the past, the San Diego Zoo was one of four zoos in the U.S. which had giant pandas on display, and was the most successful in terms of panda reproduction. The first two giant panda cubs in U.S. history to have been born in the U.S. and survive into adulthood- Hua Mei (female, born to Bai Yun and Shi Shi) and Mei Sheng (male, born to Bai Yun and Gao Gao)- were born at the San Diego Zoo, in 1999 and 2003, respectively. After that, three more giant panda cubs- Su Lin and Zhen Zhen (both females) and Yun Zi (male)- were born to the resident giant panda parents Bai Yun and Gao Gao. Xiao Liwu (meaning "little gift"), was born on July 29, 2012, and was let outside for visitors to see on January 9, 2013. All of the cubs except Xiao Liwu have since been sent back to China to participate in the breeding program there.</p>
                    <p>In addition to being able to view this rare animal species, the nearby Giant Panda Discovery Center had interactive exhibits that let the visitor experience firsthand what the animals smell and sound like. Since the closing of Panda Trek, there are now more native Chinese animals, including Sichuan takins, a red panda, Mangshan pitvipers, and an exhibit comparing several types of bamboo which are still visible. There is also a slope featuring leopards and snow leopards.</p>
